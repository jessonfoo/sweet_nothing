Hey babe, just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you. About to run in a long meeting but I'll be able to get through it knowing you're waiting for me later.
I’m thinking of you and wanted to tell you that I love you.
When I close my eyes, I see you. When I open my eyes, I see you. There is nothing I can do without thinking of you.
You + me = Happiness forever. See you later gorgeous!
I’m never going to let you go.
Thank you for supporting me. If it wasn’t for you, I’d be lost at work.
I tried but I can’t stop thinking about you!
You are in my mind every second of the day. You get me through work.
People come and go, but you and I will stay together, forever.
I want to cuddle up with you. See you when I see you!
Hey baby, can’t wait to see you tonight!
Waiting for the next time that your lips will touch mine…
My friends are so jealous that I have you.
You understand me so well. I can tell you anything.
I feel so safe with your arms around me.
I’m stealing your shirt next time I see you.
I love watching you work out.
I love how ambitious you are.
